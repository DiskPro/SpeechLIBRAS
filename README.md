# SpeechLIBRAS

Welcome to this humble project! Please read below to see more on how to contact me and more.

### What is this?

SpeechLIBRAS is a simple Android application that translates speech to both text and LIBRAS (Brazilian Portuguese Sign Language), developed with simplicity and ease of use in mind.

### Where did you get that idea?

From watching a movie where the difficulty in understanding and presenting information using LIBRAS made me cringe so much I decided to create something to help me sleep at night.

### Special thanks

Thanks to [Android Hive](https://www.androidhive.info/2014/07/android-speech-to-text-tutorial/) for providing a base for my Speech to Text routine.
